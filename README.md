#Butler
######A "real" personal assistant.
======
Butler is based on the idea that your "Personal Assistant" should be just that, Personal, and Assisting.

Butler learns about you, similar to Google Now, but much more in depth.
Butler will learn about
* Your favorite color
* Your favorite foods
* When you get up
* When you go to bed
* Where you spend the most time
* Who you communicate with the most
* Which messages(text/email) have the most priority to you
among other things.

Butler will also
* Send emails for you
* Send texts for you
* Arrange, cancel and modify meetings
* Give you your itinerary in the morning
* Inform you if stock you hold has a significant increase or decrease

You can also actually talk with Butler, not just give Him commands, and he will respond accordingly.

Butler's database is hosted on taylorcoffelt.com
